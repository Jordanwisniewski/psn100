## What is PSN 100%?
PSN 100% is a trophy tracking website, focusing on merging game stacks and removal of unobtainable trophies to create one list of only obtainable trophies where all users have the chance to get to the same level, without the need to replay the same game multiple times.

## What isn't PSN 100%?
PSN 100% is not a community for discussion (forum), gaming/boosting sessions or trophy guides. Other sites already handles this with greatness, please use them.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1
Merge stacks into one single game. This includes remastered games with same tophy list. Example:
- Jack N' Jill DX - [PS4 (AS)](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/8075-jack-n-jill-dx), [PS4 (EU)](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/8131-jack-n-jill-dx), [PS4 (NA)](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/8115-jack-n-jill-dx), [Vita (AS)](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/7975-jack-n-jill-dx), [Vita (EU)](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/8106-jack-n-jill-dx), [Vita (NA)](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/8116-jack-n-jill-dx)
- Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch - [PS3](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/1806-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch), [PS3 (JP)](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/1191-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch)
, [PS4 Remastered](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/9649-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-remastered)

### Milestone 2
Remove delisted games/DLC (and no physical release) from score tracking (still searchable/viewable). Mostly server shutdown games. Example:
- [Dead Star](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/4519-dead-star)
- [StarBlood Arena](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/6022-starblood-arena)

### Milestone 3
Remove unobtainable trophies from score tracking. Example:
- [Luftrausers](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/2470-luftrausers), "MASTER RAUSER" and "DONT MESS WITH THE RAUSER" are unobtainable.

### Milestone 4
More advanced merging of games. More discussion needs to be made before doing this. Example:
- [WipEout HD](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/36-wipeout-hd) + [WipEout 2048](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/1340-wipeout-2048) --> [WipEout Omega Collection](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/6222-wipeout-omega-collection)
  - Omega Collection is both HD (+Fury) and 2048, but the trophy list is somewhat different from each other.
- [PixelJunk Shooter](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/236-pixeljunk-shooter) + [PixelJunk Shooter 2](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/806-pixeljunk-shooter-2) --> [PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/2647-pixeljunk-shooter-ultimate)
  - Ultimate is both 1 and 2, but the trophy list is very different from each other.
- [Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/6078-shovel-knight-specter-of-torment) --> [Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/3514-shovel-knight-treasure-trove)
  - Specter of Torment into the Treasure Trove DLC, or lift out the DLC into Specter of Torment game entry?
